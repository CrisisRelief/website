      <h2>About Crisis App</h2>
      <h3>Origins</h3>
      <p>
        CrisisApp (
        <a href="https://crisis.app">https://crisis.app</a>) was forged in the 2019-2020 Australian Bushfire Crisis as a group of skilled, committed volunteers and organisations wanting to connect people in fire affected areas with helpful resources. We want to ensure peopleâ€™s generous offers of help are effectively deployed.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work together as a nimble alliance focussed on making a difference, moving fast to build information systems needed by crisis affected communities. We're spread across AU and USA locations, integrating disaster response lessons learnt from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate, along with the lived experiences of our team members and peers like

      </p>
      <p>Our international team is made up of individuals from organisations like Atlassian, Deloitte, Google, Canva, Thoughtworks, MapBox, RosieAlliance, Helping Homes, Assemblient and AusFireHack. Our team are working with an experienced team who led information gathering for rescue and recovery during the disasters in America due to Hurricanes Harvey and Maria.</p>
      <p>We saw individuals began offering help over social media to people affected by the Australian bushfires. In the scale of devastation and the number of folks rendered homeless and needing shelter, people began to offer what they could - accommodation for two people, 3 generators, a box of nappies, free paddock, agistment, pet boarding, fuel, and more.</p>
      <p>CrisisApp began as a Google sheet where people could post and find offers, and quickly scaled into a web-based app. There's more to come yet as our team improves search and discover and expands our focus on peoples pressing challenges.</p>
