# Crisis App

## Project prerequisites

To run this project locally first you will need to install:

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Project setup

Set the FontAwesome Pro key before installing for the first time, (or you'll get a 402 error)

Get the FontAwesome Pro Key from here: https://firemap.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DC/pages/7045831/FontAwesome+Pro+Key

```bash
export FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=XXX
```

Note: this is Derwent's key who has a license, just don't share this elsewhere or make this repo public. (oh shit it's public, oh well.)

Use batect to setup using the above key and install dependencies.

```bash
./batect install
```

For more information on batect, check out the [batect GitHub page](https://github.com/charleskorn/batect/)

## Contributing

- Please pick a card from the current sprint in [JIRA](https://firemap.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=3&projectKey=CAD&view=planning&issueLimit=100).
- If you create a new ticket in JIRA and it's a development ticket, remember to set the `development` label.
- We are doing [feature branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) of the develop branch,
- your branch name should be `CAD-XX` (the JIRA ticket ID)
- All commits should pass `yarn lint` before pushing (or the pipeline will fail)
- Commit messages should ideally be `[CAD-XX]<GITMOJI> short description of work`. E.g.: `[CAD-66] ðŸš² Bye, SQL!`
- GitMojis are awesome but optional [Gitmoji reference here](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) and [here](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Gitmoji.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index) - please copy the unicode gitmoji from the second guide, not just `:emoji:`
- When you've submitted a PR, set the status of the ticket to `Review` and ask for a reviewer
- When someone has merged the PR into develop, check that it passes all of the tests in [the pipeline](https://github.com/CrisisRelief/website/actions) and deploys to prod.
- Once you're happy with how it looks in develop, then you can merge into master.
- Only when you've validated that your feature has made it to prod can you change your card to done.
